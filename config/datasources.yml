# Configure Datasources.

# First, define the data-sources themselves.
# Each datasource has a "name", optionally a "no_facets" indicator, 
# optionally a list of supported "viewstyles" (standard_list, compact_list, grid?), and
# a detailed configuration for it's "search_box"
#   Name - how the datasource appears in the left datasources list
#   Title - how the datasource appears as a panel header in a bento
# 
# Next, define the "datasource_bar", really the list
# of datasources presented in the sidebar, divided
# into "major" and "minor", to control display.
